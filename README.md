# Document_Summerizer Using Llama3


## Overview  
This project is a *Document Summarizer* powered by *Llama 3*, a language model for natural language processing tasks. The application takes long-form text documents as input and provides concise, accurate summaries to save time and improve productivity. 
I have used Groq API to handle the LLM Modl.
